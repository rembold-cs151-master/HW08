Assignment Status: PENDING

_Please change the above to DONE when you finish and want the assignment to be graded!_

Due the night of Nov 1 at midnight


## Instructions
The homework pdf has the basic instructions, and you should definitely read the docstrings, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Make sure you remember to upload a pdf again on this assignment, as Problem 1 has written work.
 - [ ] Read through the docstrings before getting started! They have important information!
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob2.py` to create the your Python queue class.
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob3.py` to create your Python Fraction class.

__Remember to fill out the commented metadata at the top of each Python script!__

#### Testing
 - Prob2: All methods and general operations will be tested. Make sure you named the data attribute for your queue `self.q` as I assume that when I'm checking for lengths of the queue.
 - Prob3: All methods will be tested. Do **not** reduce any solutions anywhere in your methods besides the `reduce` method. Clearly in cases this would be desirable, but it makes the error checking more difficult in this case.
